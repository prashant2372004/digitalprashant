                    Prashant</h3>
                <p class="blod p8">For the last Seven years, we have been
                    perfecting the art of content creation on social media and
                    making ‘7-Figure Income’ out of it. Here you will learn: Who
                    we help, what we do, our philosophy & My story.</p>
                <p class="blod p8 font-size2">Who we help:</p>
                <p class="p8 font-size3 line_h">We help beginner creators,
                    amateur
                    creators, and
                    professional creators ( basically, anybody who creates
                    content or wishes to become a content creator). We only work
                    with serious content creators who really want to grow their
                    social media presence with our guidance and training. These
                    creators already have accounts on social media but they lack
                    the structures, systems, teams, tools, strategies, and
                    guidance on how to become professional content creators.</p>
                <p class="blod p8 font-size2">What we do:</p>
                <p class="p8 font-size3 line_h">We help these content creators
                    achieve “7 Figure Income” by creating their content in the
                    best possible way on different platforms and launching their
                    own businesses. We do this through our two training
                    programs: <span class="color2 blod"> DP masterclass</span> &
                    <span class="color2 blod">Consulting Mastermind</span>. Our
                    programs aim to improve the quality of content and maximize:
                    profits, creator results, and creator happiness. Also, our
                    program aims to minimize: complexity, costs, headcounts, and
                    stress.</p>
                <p class="blod p8 font-size2">Our philosophy</p>
                <p class="p8 font-size3 line_h"> <strong>“7-Figure
                        Income”</strong> in Content
                    Creation comes with the perfect balance between quality of
                    content, consistency, business knowledge, profit, creator’s
                    results, and creator’s happiness. To achieve this balance,
                    we follow a philosophy built on six core principles:</p>

                <p class="blod p8 font-size2">My Story</p>
                <p class="p8 font-size3 line_h">When I was in school, I aspired
                    to become a cricketer. In college, I tried modeling and
                    acting also. But I was not sure about the long term then.
                    Then I came to know about Digital Marketing. So we can say
                    that my career started with the completion of my graduation
                    in 2017. I started learning and practicing Digital marketing
                    in 2017.</p>
                <p class="p8 font-size3 line_h">After learning all the skills
                    needed, I worked as a Senior Client relationship executive
                    at the Delhi School of Internet Marketing (DSIM) for 1 year.
                    In 2018, I got selected as a Digital marketing executive at
                    Speaking Tiger Pvt Ltd. At that time, I was so passionate
                    about my youtube channel and started recording videos after
                    office hours. Yeah, that was really hard but I am passionate
                    about teaching people so I started to teach Digital
                    Marketing on Youtube.</p>
                <p class="p8 font-size3 line_h">Finally, a time came in 2019
                    when I decided to quit my job and started building my
                    personal brand through content creation. It was a long and
                    tough time for me but after 3 years of consistent efforts
                    and patience, Prashant bambharoliya made himself a brand
                    named <strong class="color2"> Digital Prashant</strong>.</p>
                <p class="p8 font-size3 line_h">I would describe myself as a
                    Creators Coach by profession and an entrepreneur by heart.
                    So after continuously making content, in 2020, I received
                    the Silver play button from Youtube. Also started my
                    marketing agency and helped many companies to achieve their
                    targets through digital marketing. Meanwhile, I have given
                    150+ marketing consultations to various business owners/
                    marketing executives. After that, the pandemic hit and I had
                    to stop my marketing agency. But I didn’t stop there.</p>
                <p class="p8 font-size3 line_h">In the past few months, I have
                    been able to build a
                    profitable content creation business and have started my
                    digital marketing agency named Creators Marketing as well
                    because I realized the power of a personal brand on social
                    media. I believe that the current scenario of content
                    creation can be improved and people can launch massive
                    education businesses via these platforms. That’s why I
                    started Creators Marketing to help these creators grow fast.
                </p>
                <p class="p8 font-size3 line_h">In short, if you ask me what I
                    do. I am a <strong>brand builder</strong> and take
                    businesses to the next level with my profit-maximizing
                    strategies.</p>
